## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

This curated planning project demonstrates that successful travel in 2026 relies on distinguishing between "permission" (ETIAS) and "protection" (Insurance), and between "transit" (Metro) and "travel" (RER). By mapping out these distinctions early, the 10-day itinerary moves beyond simple sightseeing into a structured architectural and cultural immersion. The use of "curator cards" transforms a standard vacation into a designed experience where logistics support—rather than hinder—discovery.
