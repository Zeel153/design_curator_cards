# AGENTS.md — AI Instructions

> This file is your "master letter" to the AI. Everything the AI needs to know about your project goes here.
> You will write a version of this file for every project this semester.
>
> **For this assignment**, the audience and constraints are defined for you below.
> **For future projects** (Design Museum, Business Site, Portfolio), you'll define your own audience, tone, and constraints from scratch.

## Audience & Tone

<!-- WHY THIS IS SET: Museum labels target a specific reader. Defining audience
     prevents the AI from writing for the wrong context (too academic, too casual). -->

- **Audience:** You and future users with general interest in travel planning
- **Tone:** Friendly but precise — clear instructions, no fluff or filler
- **Reading level:** Educated adult, avoid unexplained jargon

## Hard Constraints

- **Word count per card:** 80–120 words
- **Number of cards:** 3 (Bauhaus, Swiss Style, Reaction)
- **Vocabulary tags per card:** exactly 5
- **Example links per card:** exactly 2 (must be real, working URLs)
- **Required elements per card:**
  - "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
  - "I verified this by checking [source]."

## Banned Words

<!-- WHY THIS MATTERS: Vague words waste tokens and dilute meaning.
     In your Business Site project, you'll build a different banned list
     (e.g., banning "synergy," "leverage," "best-in-class"). -->

Do not use these vague words in any card:

- creative, innovative, revolutionary, iconic
- interesting, unique, beautiful, amazing
- game-changing, groundbreaking, cutting-edge
- basically, essentially, literally

Replace with specific domain vocabulary.

## Controlled Vocabulary

<!-- THIS IS YOUR JOB: Build this list during Exploration (Phase 1).
     Run the vocabulary prompt from the Prompt Pack, then SELECT the terms
     that are actually useful. Discard the rest. Aim for 15–25 terms.
     For the Design Museum, your team will build a shared vocabulary.
     For the Business Site, this list will include Cialdini, Maslow, archetype terms. -->

Use these terms. If a term is not on this list, define it before using it.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Vorkurs | Bauhaus foundation course teaching materials, form, and color |
| Travel budget | Total money allocated for the whole trip |
| Itinerary | A day-by-day plan of activities and logistics |
| Transit pass | A pre-paid pass allowing unlimited local transport |
| Sightseeing priority | Ranking of attractions by interest level |
| Local food specialty | A traditional dish or cuisine of the destination |
| Cave à Vin | A wine cellar or shop that often serves small plates |
| Service Compris | Service included"—means the tip is already in the price of your meal |
| Vernissage | An art gallery opening or preview (common in Le Marais) |
| ETIAS | European Travel Information and Authorization System (Pre-entry security) |
| Schengen Area | The zone of 27 European countries with no internal border controls |
| Navigo Découverte | The physical smart card for weekly unlimited transit |
| Arrondissement | One of the 20 administrative districts of Paris |
| RER | Réseau Express Régional (High-speed trains connecting Paris to suburbs |
| | |

*Aim for 15–25 terms total. Build this list during your Exploration phase.*

## Verification Rule

If you are unsure about any fact, date, attribution, or claim: write **VERIFY** instead of guessing. I will check it myself.

Do not invent quotes. Do not fabricate anecdotes. Do not attribute ideas to people without sourced evidence.
