## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1.My destination is Paris
2.I want to travel for 10 days
3.I know my budget is about $500-$700

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1.Best places to visit in the time I have
2.How long to spend at each major site
3.Transportation options and estimated costs

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.
```

1.Itinerary – a detailed plan for my days
2.Sightseeing priority – ranking of attractions by interest level
3.Local transport passes – e.g., metro cards, city travel cards
